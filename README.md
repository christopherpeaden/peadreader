This is an Atom and RSS feed reader I am building using Ruby on Rails. You can aggregate all your favorite rss feeds
and view them all from one place. It supports omniauth sign in with your google+ account to view your youtube subscriptions as well.
I plan on adding more omniauth identities in the future for viewing all your favorite social media, e.g., reddit, twitter.
